Problem:
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after growth n cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is, the calculations are as follows:
Period  Height
0          1
1          2
2          3
3          6 
4          7
5          14

Code:

import os

# Complete the 'utopianTree' function below.
#
# The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
# The function accepts INTEGER n as parameter.

def utopianTree(n):
    # Write your code here
    
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return pow(2,(n+3)//2) - 1
    else:
        return pow(2,(n+3)//2) - 2
    
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    fptr = open(os.environ['OUTPUT_PATH'], 'w')

    t = int(input().strip())

    for t_itr in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())

        result = utopianTree(n)

        fptr.write(str(result) + '\n')

    fptr.close()
